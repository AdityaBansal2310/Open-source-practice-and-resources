## Resource Qualification
Resources have to be in the form of links. Allowed resources can be videos, articles, tutorials, or anything similar. It has to be helpful, whether as a tool to be used or as a source of information.

Here are some rules to follow when adding a resource: 

* single blog posts are not accepted. This is simply because if single blog posts are allowed then this list would be endless. There could be some exceptions, like if the single post is very extensive or includes details that are hard to find elsewhere. If the resource you're adding falls under the exception then please detail that in the PR
* If you want to add multiple links of the same topic under the same website, just include a general link that might lead to all these links. For example, instead of adding multiple Youtube videos under the same series, add the playlist link.
* Take the time to make sure the resource has not been already added as it saves the maintainers time when reviewing your pull request.
